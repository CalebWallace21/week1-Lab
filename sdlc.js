// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The next step is to define and document requirements and seek stakeholder approval. Define what the application is meant to do, any features that would be included, and roadblocks along the way. Resources would also need to be identified and built into the project in order to define requirements."
const design = "requires a designing step that models how the application will work and aspects of the design"
const implementation = "This is the phase of SDLC where the program itself is written out, either using a single developer or a large team each working on different parts of the development. SDLC can anticipate issues in the software development process that can hold up production, like waiting for test results or compiling code."
const testing ="Applications must be tested continuously to ensure that they are going to run well together, as software development is often broken down into smaller projects completed by separate individuals and teams. Ensure that each function runs as it should and that each part of the application is interacting well with other parts."
const integration = "An application is deployed once testing is completed, which makes it available to users. This step of the process can be manual or automated, depending on the complexity and needs of the application."
const maintain = "Once the application has been deployed and is being used, the final phase discovers bugs that slipped through the cracks during testing and resolves themâ€”this can start its own iterative process."
